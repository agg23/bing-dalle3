## Bing DALL-E 3 Utility Extension
![Logo](../assets/logo/Bing%20DALL-E%203%20128.png)

Automatically save all of your DALL-E generated images as you make them. Every image generated will be tracked, and a custom UI allows you to selectively export the images you want, see old prompts, and more.

On visiting https://www.bing.com/images/create, a `See all` button will be injected over the stock image history. Clicking it will open the main view of the extension, allowing you to see your past images and their prompts. You can also export multiple images together, or even combine them into one composite image.
